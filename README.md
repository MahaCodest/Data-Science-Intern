          UNIT 1:
                                     
                DS Process:
                  
                    *Detailed predictions of what the future will hold 
                    *The power of data science comes from a deep understanding of statistics and algorithms, programming and hacking,       communication skills.
                    Frame the problem
                    Collect the raw data needed to solve the problem: 
                    Process the data
                    Explore the data
                    Perform in-depth analysis
                    Communicate results of the analysis
           
       Frame the problem 
       
           Ask the right questions depends on the Client Requirements
           
       Collect the right data
       
           Data can be collectd from the specified company CRM software which has in SQL table formats. 
           Extract the required Fata from the available SQL Database that can also be available in JSON format as Web API.
           Concentrate on Customer Privacy and Declaration policy while handling with their data.
           Segragate the required data as Data set as of now, Its large to hold, Extract the data in CSV file format     
         
       Process the data
       
           Data Cleaning is the Tedious Process for Data Scientist day to day life.
           Focus and Patience must be attain to succeed in this process
           Check any Errors found in CSV file in Client requirement view.
           Decide how to choose the right data from unclear format sense for your specific problem
           FInally, Prepare for Exploring analysis after the Data Wrangling 
           
       Explore your data
       
          The Process of finding which parts of the data are significant in answering your questions step is called exploratory data analysis.
          Predict some information from the found data and match it with the available and unavailable Customer,
          Make a difference and set some value as how proceed with the work and group the predicted data with initial prerequites
          Eventually,  This processed dataset to find a set of factors that could solve client's original problem
         
 Step 5 : Analyze Your Data In Depth 
 
          Data Scientist need to identify which is feature and Label, After finding it apply thode identified features in Machine Learning technique like Supervised Learning.
          Contrary to supervised learning, unsupervised learning techniques extract information from data without any labels supplied
          As last Step communicate our results to our client in a way that is compelling and comprehensible for them
          
Step 6 : Visualize and Communicate Your Findings

         Communication is one of the most underrated skills for a data scientist 
         Present Our Result in Visual formats such as Spreadsheet to client View
         As part of our role as the interpreter of data, We will be often called upon to make recommendations about how others should use your results.
         At last We are done that exploring Technology with Business Concern makes the career path of data science so challenging, and so valuable.
